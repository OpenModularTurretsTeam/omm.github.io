Hello everyone,
<br>
here is a big announcement for OMT.
After reading about the requirements to port OMT to 1.14 I have decided that OpenModularTurrets will skip v.3.2.x and jump directly to 4.0.x  (both 1.12 and 1.14 then). This will be a breaking change release, meaning you cannot use worlds which contained v3.x OMT things but will have to create a new world*.

v4.0 will contain multiblock bases and significant changes to turrets requirements and the upgrade/addon system. Also some new means for power generation within OMT, nothing big, but at least some furnace type generater will be added. These new systems will provide a good foundation for more content in the future.

The release will be rather big and the required changes to port it to 1.14 at the same time are also quite a lot to do. For those interested in how far the progress is, the Issues page of OMT/OMLib will probably be a good source of information about that.

For more details about the new features/changes check out the roadmap [here](/roadmap/) or in the upper right corner.

Greetings and have fun

\* Or you could remove OMT from old world, start & shutdown server and then
install v4.0
